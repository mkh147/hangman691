## Description

This Hangman game allows players to guess a randomly chosen word from a predefined list of words. The player has a limited number of lives, and each incorrect guess reduces the number of lives by one. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.

### Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to provide a simple yet engaging command-line game that helps users practice and enjoy word guessing. It also serves as an educational exercise in implementing game logic, handling user input, and managing game state in Python.

### What I Learned
- Handling user input in Python
- Using lists, sets, and loops effectively
- Implementing game logic
- Error handling and input validation
- Implementing Object Orientated Programming
